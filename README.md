Write up:
For my open-source evaluation, I looked at the Github repository for Phaser. As an open-source software, anyone can clone the repository and work on the source code to improve it and add new features. However, merging their features back into the master branch is a feature that is only allowed to those with write access. This is done to prevent anyone from throwing in random garbage into the repository. People can also report current issues with the code, and make feature requests if they have an idea, to which the community can see it and anyone with an interest in the idea can work on it. Overall, it's community driven with the final word going to the creators.
